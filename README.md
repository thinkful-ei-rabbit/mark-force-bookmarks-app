## Summary

 URL Bookmarking application used to bookmark URLs for future reference! Built with jQuery, this application can store URL's, a brief description of the website to be bookmarked, a nickname for the URL, as well as a rating determined by the user. 
 
## The stack

  I built this application from the ground up utilizing the JavaScript library jQuery, HTML, and vanilla CSS styling. I utilized best-practices on the front-end to make asynchrynous requests to the RESTful server on the backend to send and recieve JSON data. JavaScript was used to both send and recieve AJAX requests.
